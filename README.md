# Open-LLM

This project aims to take Glific interactions to the next level by seamlessly integrating OpenAI's Language Model to generate contextually accurate responses from the custom knowledge base. This will be a standalone repository within the Glific ecosystem and will be hosted separately. Through the use of Glific webhooks, this will be connected to the Glific instance for better contextual response through the chatbot
